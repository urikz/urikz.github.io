I'm a fifth-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California, advised by professor [Fei Sha](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~feisha). Before joining graduate school, I worked on Neural Machine Translation at the Applied Machine Learning team from Facebook. I got my specialist (5 years) degree in Computer Science and Math from St. Petersburg State University with professor [Alexander Vakhitov](https://alexandervakhitov.github.io) as my thesis advisor.

I'm interested broadly in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, focusing on text and entity representations, memory augmented models and reasoning over text.
